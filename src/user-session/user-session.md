# UserSession Module

###Entity responsible for managing user session lifecycle and authentication state.

The UserSession entity is used internally by the Auth module to securely track and validate active user sessions. It plays a critical role in enforcing authentication by associating users with valid session tokens or metadata, such as device identifiers or expiration timestamps.

This module enables the platform to:
- Maintain session persistence across requests.Validate whether a user is actively logged in.
- Support features like token revocation, logout, or session expiration handling.
- Enhance security by tracking multiple sessions per user (e.g., across different devices or browsers).
